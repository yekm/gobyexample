# Go by Example

Content and build toolchain for [Go by Example](https://yekm.github.io/gobyexample),
a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.

### Overview

The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and
comments from source files in `examples` and rendering
them via the `templates` into a static `public`
directory. The programs implementing this build process
are in `tools`.
