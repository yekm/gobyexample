# Go by Example

Content and build toolchain for [Go by Example](https://yekm.github.io/gobyexample),
a site that teaches Go via annotated example programs.

### Overview

The Go by Example site is built by extracting code and
comments from source files in `examples` and rendering
them via the `templates` into a static `public`
directory. The programs implementing this build process
are in `tools`.

### Building

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/yekm/gobyexample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/yekm/gobyexample)
 
See `Makefile`

### Publishing

Travis pushes to gh-pages. Set `DKEY` env var in travis
settings to a base64 encoded content of your deploy key.

### TODO

- [ ] prettify index.html
- [ ] add link to github for every example
- [ ] add usual full example output below the table
